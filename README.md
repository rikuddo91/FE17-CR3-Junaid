# FE17-CR3-Junaid

Benvenuto al Ristorante Il Gambero Rosso. In this CodeReview, you have to create a Delivery page for the best Restaurant in Padova Province, in the North of Italy, using Angular obviously.  

GUI guideline: You are allowed to use CSS and/or bootstrap. 

In order to accomplish this project, you will need to create at least 7 pages/components: NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart) (you are free to create additional components if you have time and inspiration). 

The NavBar will be always showing no matter what component is triggered, the same for the Footer. Home and About Us should have static content. 

Menu will hold dynamic content created from objects. On clicking on the Details button it should lead to the details page which will bring specific information from that dish. 

Also uploaded the dev-build on, http://junaid.codefactory.live/
